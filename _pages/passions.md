Outside of science, here's some things I enjoy doing.

**Mentorship**
======

Much of my personal fulfillment comes from discussing with people who (for some reason) want my advice. 

In [The XPeriment](https://www.thebruinexperiment.com/), I got students excited about science. The yearly science fairs are some of my best memories and represent the culimination of diligence and hard work on the part of the students. I was a wall that they could lean on, but my philosophy of mentorship involcves letting students struggle just enough to figure out their projects and learn.

I'd be happy to chat with anyone about pursuing research, medicine, or college admissions/major planning. 

I don't charge, nor do I bite.

**Reading**
======

My fondest memories of childhood are biking to a nearby park, sitting down under a tree, and reading. Childhood favorites of mine are *The Giver*, *Oh, The Places You'll Go*, and *Calvin and Hobbes*.

Current favorites of mine include (but are not limited to) *Being Mortal* by Atul Gawande, *The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down* by Anne Fadiman, and anything by Kurt Vonnegut (*Cat's Cradle* is a favorite). 

If you have a good book recommendation of any genre, I'm more than happy to hear about it.
