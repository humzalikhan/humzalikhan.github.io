I'm a 4th year UCLA student studying Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics. Quite a mouthful, I know. If you care for some credentials, they're listed in my CV [here](https://humzalikhan.github.io/cv/). 

I've spent the past 2 and a half years working in the Butte lab, performing both basic science and translational immunology research. My biggest undertaking is an independent project to better understand Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) using higher dimensional data analytics and novel data science methods. 

Some other things I care about, in no particular order, are: mentorship to underserved populations (especially in STEM), reproducibility in science, photography, reading, learning deeply about random topics, and (failing at) the harmonica.

If you're interested in any of this, please do take a look around or shoot me a line via email.
