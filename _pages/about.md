I just graduated with my BS from UCLA in Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics. Quite a mouthful, I know. If you want some specifics, they're listed in my CV [here](https://humzalikhan.github.io/cv/). 

I've spent the past three working in the Butte lab, performing both basic science and translational immunology research. My biggest undertaking is an independent project to better understand Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) using higher dimensional data analytics and novel data science methods. 

Some other things I care about, in no particular order, are: mentorship to underserved populations (especially in STEM), reproducibility in science, photography, reading, scrolling endlessly through Wikipedia, and (failing at) the harmonica.

If you're interested in any of this, go ahead and take a look around or shoot me a line via email.
