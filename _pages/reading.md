I'm trying to keep track of what I read. In the past, I've been smart enough to annotate my books and write when I start and finish them, but too dumb to have written down what I've read. 

**What I'm Reading**
* *Between The World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates

**What I Want to Read**
* *Thinking Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman (sorely overdue)
* *The Plague* by Albert Camus
* *The Namesake* by Jhumpa Lahiri
* *Deep Medicine* by Eric Topol
* *Cat's Cradle* by Kurt Vonnegut
* *The Bell Jar* by Sylvia Plath
* *The Color Purple* by Alice Walker


**What I've Read in 2020**
* *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* by Milan Kundera
  * I finished this book and was underwhelmed at first, but found myself returning to the ideas of a "light" and "heavy" life     time and time again. My metric for a good book revolves around how much I think about it after I read it. Considering I 
    still think about these themes, I'd say it was a great book. I think I didn't connect with the characters personally, but     the search for meaning and love in the face of drastic societal unrest resonated with me greatly. 
* *The Island of Dr. Moreau* by H.G. Wells
  * Some good, weird sci-fi. A friend suggested I read this after taking a class linking the book to the ethics of genetic 
    engineering. If not framed in that manner, I probably wouldn't have thought about it that way. Still decent, though!
* *No Time to Lose* by Peter Piot
  * This book discusses several pandemics. While incredibly interesting, I got 250 pages in until I realized it made me more
     anxious about COVID and gave up on it.
* *Slaughterhouse-Five* by Kurt Vonnegut
  * One of my favorite books; when I first read it in 2015, this book ardently affirmed my stance as a pacifist. War is an 
    ugly thing that beast released by legislative executives who do not feel the brunt of it. War hurts the working class and 
    disenfranchised most, physically and mentally. By using time travel as a guise for PTSD, Vonnegut created a 
    heartbreakingly hilarious piece of fiction that sardonically discusses the bombing of Dresden and Billy Pilgrim's mental 
    collapse in the years following. 
  * Vonnegut writes so child-like and hilariously; I emulate him in most of what I write.
* *The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down* by Anne Fadiman
  * Fadiman changed my mind on Western medicine. I used to cling to the ideal that modern medicine and science could be a 
    panacea for all of the world's problems. The book follows the Lees, a Hmong refugee family, and their struggle to treat 
    their daughter for epilepsy with Hmong folk medicine and Western medicine. The story is a heartbreaking struggle of 
    miscommunication and cultural discordance between US healthcare and the Hmong community. How can you explain the clinical 
    efficacy of Dilantin to an illiterate family whose self-sufficiency has been stolen from them by a US sponsored war? 
  * In context of COVID, rampant systemic racism (in science, too!), and the polarization of our society, this book convinced 
    that we need more than science for a harmonious, equitable society. 
* *How We Do Harm* by Otis Brawley and Paul Goldberg
  * Another killer book which made me question the American medical system deeply. Why aren't there evidence-based guidelines     for treatment of widespread disorders, such as melanoma or breast cancer? Why is off-label drug use permissible in common     disease scenarios, even if there isn't scientific evidence for their effectiveness? We need logic and science more than       ever and it is a disgrace to medicine that we have veered so far from them. We don't live in the age of Hippocrates and       postulation anymore; we live in the era of statistics and rationality. By no means do I think research and science are         perfect, but they are all we have in the fight against disease and the fight for humanity. 
  * Note: I work in rare disease; some of the points in the book wouldn't apply to these patients. If you have an n=1 rare 
    mutation in a child, how are you ever going to do an RCT? It is better to treat as rationally as possible at that point. 
* *The Stranger* by Albert Camus (Read #2)
  * Mersault embodies the Absurd. Throughout the book, he acknowledges that his decisions would not matter one way or another--saying that he would marry his mistress just as he'd marry anyone else, that it didn't matter that his mother was far         away while sick, that it didn't matter if he died at thirty or eighy. Mersault drifts through life with minimal ambition       or direction, besides his physical instincts. He has sex, eats, works, sleeps, and repeats. Mersault is Camus' antithesis     to the realization of an absurd, indifferent universe. Mersault creates no meaning for himself. 
  * Camus, on the other hand, was known for his handsomeness, his boisterous nature, and his kindness. He loved life in the       face of the Absurd, something that anyone who discovers the indifference of the universe should emulate. He loved humanity     and people; he once said that he learned much of his personal philosophy from the teamwork and ambition of soccer. In the     face of an indifferent world, we can only hope to live with as much zest for life as Camus--and to stay away from the         listless, laconic nature of Mersault.
