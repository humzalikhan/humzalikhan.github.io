I care about helping patients through understanding the immune system. I have a commitment to work across the research spectrum––from basic science studies to clinical data analysis. Generally, though, my heart lies in the lab. 

I've also been keeping track of the papers I read [here](https://humzalikhan.github.io/papers/).
