[Multifaceted Effects of Antigen Valency on B Cell Response Composition and Differentiation In Vivo](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320303344)

Summary: Antigen valency is key in vaccines, both for short-term B cell activation and for long-term plasma cell response. In a transgenic+polyclonal transfer model, HIV antigen (eOD-GT5) 60-mers elicit far greater initial responses (proliferation, B cell activation assessed via CCR7/CD44, CD69) in vivo as well as promote B cell migration to the T cell zone in lymph nodes. CD4 help is necessary for the maturation of these B cells into early germinal center B cells and plasma cells, but not for initial division and activation (though I wonder the absolute valency threshold for this; they only compared 4mers and 60mers).  

Interestingly, valency seems to play a larger role in than affinity in establishing robust humoral immunological memory. Low affinity, high valency complexes were far more similar to high affinity, high valency complexes than high affinity, low valency complexes in establishing the aforementioned immunity measured by B cell activation and plasma cell/germinal center B cell formation. Some pretty convincing work here showing that even low affinity, high avidity targets will cause T cell-B cell interactions and initial B cell division, though slower. They used a transfer model of HIV antigen specific B cells, and SMARTA (LCMV gp61-80 specific) T cells and vaccinated with an LCMV epitope (gp61-80) threaded into the aforementioned eOD-GT2/5 (low/high affinity for the engineered B cells) HIV antigen. 

They also found that higher valency vaccines recruit a broader repertoire of B cells with lower overall affinity to respond to antigenic challenge. That is, even with high affinity, lower antigen valency creates a competition where only highly specific B cells can respond. 

Thoughts: I would have been really interested in seeing some 10x BCR sequencing data on the B cells between high and low valency. That could have driven home the point that there is increased clonality of B cells in high valency vaccinations. Overall, super cool work and it shows how important a thorough understanding of the physician landscape of antigens are in both initial and memory immune response.
